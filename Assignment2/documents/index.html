    <p>Mandelbrot Set task time done by one computer: <br/> 160,636 ms </p>
    <p>Mandelbrot Set task time done by two computers: <br/> 79,122 ms </p>
    <p>TSP task time done by one computer: <br/> 29,398 ms </p>
    <p>TSP task time done by two computers: <br/> 23,345 ms </p>

    <p>The Mandelbrot Set task if run by two computers takes about half time if ran by only one computer. Yet the TSP task doesn't shorten the time by half; in fact it only improves about 20%, which is kind of strange. The reason that it can't be shorten by half might be: <br/>The task doesn't always equally split into half and give each computer the same amount to finish and each computer takes the same time to run the job. More often, one computer is faster than another and sometimes a computer will end up doing nothing and waiting for a new job. There is also a latence issue in which it takes time for a computer to grab a job that the client pushes to the queue, and also for a client to grab a result that the computer finishes computing. The reason why the improvement of Mandelbrot Set task for two computers is better than TSP might be the fact that Mandelbrot Set task is splitted into many more subtasks than TSP, so that each computer won't have to wait for a job. I split it one pixel per task. Yet for TSP there are only 10 tasks.</p>
    <p>I think it is also worth recording how much time each computer spends in total, including computing and waiting time. Use that to compare the total time each computer spends in actually computing, we can know how much time the computer wastes on waiting for a job.</p>
